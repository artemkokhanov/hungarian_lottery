Asymptotic Run Time Analysis:

Preprocessing Phase:
Let P be the number of players
Reading the file line-by-line = O(P)
Populating bitsets:
O(MAX_NUM * (P/64))
MAX_NUM = 90
O(90 * (P/64)) = O(P) because constants are ignored
Filling bitsets:
Setting 5 bits per player is O(1) because 5 is a constant
Therefore, setting 5 bits for P players = O(P * 1) = O(P)
Total = O(P) + O(P) + O(P) = O(3*P) = O(P) because constants are ignored
Query Phase:
Each query involves a fixed amount of work:
Fixed 5 number winning combination
Computing the intersections counts:
Using the combination equation to find the number of sets that can be made from a larger set:
Based on all 2-subsets of the 5 chosen numbers. There are C(5,2) = 10 pairs
based on all 3-subsets of the 5 chosen numbers. There are C(5,3) = 10 triples
C(5,4) = 5 quadruples
all chosen numbers = 1
Therefore we have 10 + 10 + 5 + 1 = 26 intersection operations per query
Cost of each intersection operation:
Each intersection iterates over the bitset arrays and performs a bitwise AND and a count operation
There are P players and each uint64 holds 64 players, therefore the number of uint64 words per bitset is ~ P/64
Therefore the Query complexity would be O(26 * (P/64)) = O(P)
In summary, As P (number of players) grows, both processing and querying times scale linearly with P


How you could further improve the calculation speed or handle more players:

One way to further improve the calculation speed/handle more players would be to use goroutines to parallelize computing the intersections. This would lead to faster and more efficient query processing.

For large datasets, you could use GPU acceleration for parallel bitwise operations, however, this method is more complex as well leveraging additional tooling such as CUDA and OpenCL.

You could also use Sharding or Distributed systems for extremely large datasets (hundreds of millions of players). You could split players across multiple servers or processes, perform intersections in parallel, and aggregate the results.

These are a few examples of how we could further improve the calculator speed/handle more players.
